# Hidden_Smart_Home_Bookshelf
Project Alexandria is a fully enclosed, google home integrated hidden bookshelf with automated opening/closing capability. Perfect little DIY project when you want a more subtle place to store the important goods in your house.


Code is based on the adafruit Gmail Servo project, initially designed by Brent Rubell and can be found here https://learn.adafruit.com/gmailbox/code 

When downloading the file, the arduino.ino code must also have the config.h file attached. Please update the required field such as Adafruit username, IO key and wifi credentials as stated in the gmailbox code
